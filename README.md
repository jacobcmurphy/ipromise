## IPromise

An attempted implementation of the Promise/A+ spec.
It also implements `IPromise.resolve`, `IPromise.reject`, and `IPromise.all` for convenience.

## Motivation

IPromise was written to give a single file implementation of a Promise so someone can more easily trace the code and see how a Promise works internally. This is meant as a learning aid and not as a production ready implementation of Promises.
